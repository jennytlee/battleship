This is a basic vPython program that models the game Battleship. One of the two players is an automated computer, whose ships are automatically generated using the setOpps() function. Before the game begins, a 2D representation of the board is provided for the user to place his or her own ships. Then the game proceeds to run back and forth between the two players. The user inputs a guess target, which, upon input, a missile is shot in projectile motion towards the specified target. The computer randomly selects a target to hit.

How to play:
1. Build your board! Enter the pin for the head of the ship in the form "A0" where A is the column and 0 is the row. Then Enter the pin for the direction of the ship (v for vertical, h for horizontal).
	The program will then automatically generate the ships on the board for both the user and the opponent, visible in grutor mode.

2. Play the game. Enter a peg pin to shoot a missile.
	A missile will fly towards the directed peg.

3. The game will proceed until one of the players no longer have anymore ships left on the board, and the user will be prompted whether he/she wants to play again.

Other controls:
There are no other controls other than to enter peg pins.
The mouse controls will move the view of the board (but it may lag).

Enjoy!
